# The Rise of NFTs: From an Experiment to a $17B Market

NFTs didn’t appear overnight. What began as simple blockchain experiments evolved into one of the biggest digital revolutions of the decade.

The journey started with **Colored Coins on Bitcoin (2012)**, an early attempt to represent unique assets on-chain. In **2014**, digital artist **Kevin McCoy** created *Quantum*, widely recognized as the **first NFT**, proving digital ownership could be verifiable and tradable.

Momentum grew with **Rare Pepes on Bitcoin** and exploded on Ethereum. The launch of **CryptoPunks in 2017** introduced true digital scarcity, while **ERC-721 (2018)** standardized NFTs, unlocking interoperability across platforms.

Then came **2021** — NFT trading volume surged **21,000% to $17 billion**, Beeple sold a single artwork for **$69 million**, and global brands and celebrities rushed in. NFTs were no longer niche experiments—they became a mainstream digital asset class.
