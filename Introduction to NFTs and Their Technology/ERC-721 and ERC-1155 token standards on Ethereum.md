# ERC-721 vs ERC-1155: Understanding NFT Standards in Simple Terms

NFTs rely on token standards to define how they are created, transferred, and managed on the blockchain. Among them, **ERC-721** and **ERC-1155** are the most widely used Ethereum standards—but they serve very different purposes.

**ERC-721** was the first standard to introduce true non-fungible tokens. Each token is completely unique, making it ideal for digital art, collectibles, and one-of-a-kind assets. However, this uniqueness comes at a cost—higher gas fees and inefficiency when minting or transferring large numbers of NFTs.

To solve these limitations, **ERC-1155** was introduced. It allows multiple token types—fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible—to exist within a single smart contract. With features like batch minting and transfers, ERC-1155 significantly reduces transaction costs and is especially popular in blockchain gaming and metaverse projects.

While ERC-721 focuses on simplicity and uniqueness, ERC-1155 prioritizes scalability and efficiency. Choosing the right standard depends on your project’s goals, cost constraints, and future expansion plans.
