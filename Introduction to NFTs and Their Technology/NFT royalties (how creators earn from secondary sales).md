## NFT Royalties: How Digital Artists Earn from Every Resale

For years, digital artists faced a tough reality—once their artwork was sold, they earned nothing from its future success. NFT royalties are changing that forever. Powered by smart contracts, NFT royalties ensure creators automatically receive a percentage every time their digital art is resold, creating a long-term and sustainable income stream.

By embedding royalty terms directly into NFTs, artists can earn from growing demand, rising prices, and secondary market trades—without relying on intermediaries. Whether it’s setting the right royalty percentage, choosing a creator-friendly marketplace, or using no-code tools to deploy smart contracts, NFT royalties put control back into the hands of creators.

This guide explains:
- What NFT royalties are and why they matter  
- How smart contracts automate royalty payments  
- How much royalty artists typically earn  
- Which platforms truly support creator royalties  
- Common mistakes that can cost artists future income  

If you’re a digital artist, NFT creator, or Web3 enthusiast, understanding NFT royalties is no longer optional—it’s essential for building lasting value from your work.
